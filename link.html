      <p>She looked over her bifocals, an espresso cup stained from that mornings Pilon on the table with nothing else but a Citibank pen and an old notepad. I sat across from her, I admired the wrinkles on her face, each so delicately formed from her 95 years of life. I began to see her as not only my Nana but as a woman who devoted her life, and heart to her guitar, her voice and her family.</p>
  
  <p><em>Dimelo Erica, que quieres saber?</em> “Tell me Erica, what do you want to know?” 
    There were 15 siblings, 12 sisters and 3 brothers. They all lived together under one roof in Santiago de Cuba.<em> Mi mama lo hacia chancletas de carton, eran muy populares</em> “My mom used to make sandals out of cardboard, those were very popular.” </p>
  <p> At 6, 7, and 8 years old Albertina (Trini), Olga and Cusa Marquez began singing together in their backyard to their family. They family would gather on the family swing their father made and the sisters would practice. Soon they brought their act the dock to perform for American sailors and collect change. Albertina would grab her guitar and they would climb up on the tables to perform. <em>Eso era muy embarasozo</em> “it was very embarrassing.” But the family of 17 needed the money. Trini recalled how her sisters would ask her to bring them back a quarter or a dime. </p>
   <p> Three of Trini, Olga and Nerza’s older sisters had already formed a trio. During one memorable performance the venue gave the little trio the opportunity to share the stage with their older sisters. Unfortunately for the big sisters, the little ones received more applause from the crowd. Trini’s eyes lit up and she shuffled in her seat as she remembered how exciting that was. </p>
    <p>From there they began performing more and more and eventually made it to Havana where they were signed by a very popular radio station (CMQ) and snagged the morning show spot. Once in Havana their careers really began to take shape. They began do advertisements and eventually began touring the Americas. </p>
       
    <p>Eyes closed Trini began to list the places that they visit, with each new memory a new name added to the notepad. In 1951, Las Hermanas Marquez were contracted for 2 weeks at the chateau Havana-Madrid Club, a very popular Latin dance club at the time, attributed as one of the clubs to bring Latin music to NY. They came from Cuba with their father and were received so well that they were asked to stay for another 6 weeks.  That is where they met their first agent that wasn’t their father, Bert Jonas.  Bert Jonas decided that he would take them on for a trial run and have them come with him to perform at a venue in Atlantic City, NJ. The performance, again, was so well received that Bert decided to take them on and help them progress there career. No es por nada pero Bert era el agente de Sammy Davis Jr. “not for nothing but Bert Jonas was Sammy Davis Jr’s agent” she said. The trio traveled America and worked with Bert Jonas for 11 years sending money to their family in Cuba, and helping them come to America. Unfortunately this all came to an end when the youngest, Olga Marquez, got married and quit the trio. </p>
  <blockquote>Her tone softened, and Trini took a long pause, as if absorbing the memories of those eleven years in that moment. </blockquote>
    <p>With very little English and no more than a 6th grade education Trini, began working, outside of music, for the first time in America. Although no longer performing anytime more than one sister was in the same room music could always be heard. But all hope for future performances was not lost. When Trini’s mother got sick Nerza moved into her apartment. They began practicing and eventually decided to revive “Las Hermanas Marquez” as a duet. They began performing again little by little until they met world renowned Cuban saxophonist Paquito D’Rivera. Even though he was from a younger generation of Cuban musicians in NY, Paquito took the new duet, recorded a cd, booked performances, and took these octogenarians on tour in Spain. In 2011 the new “Hermanas Marquez” accepted a “lifetime achievement award” Latin Grammy.</p>

   <p> Now 94 and 95 Nerza and Trini live on the 9th floor of a building on 143rd and Broadway where Trini has lived for the past 56 years. Each day Trini wakes up, wipes down Nerza’s recliner sits in her spot on the couch, turns on the TV and patiently waits for her home attendant Carmen. Once Carmen arrives, she makes them breakfast. They eat and have coffee and Trini goes back to her spot on the couch. At around 1:30 Nerza wakes up and eats her breakfast. They eat dinner at 4 and watch Caso Cerrado, a popular Jerry Springer like show on Telemundo, until 7:30. Every night at 7:30 they make their way to the kitchen and play 4 and a half hours of Canasta, a popular card game in our family. At 12 am they make their way to the bathroom and then to their beds. </p>
    <p>As they get older the days they sing together grow farther and farther apart.  Nana was the only sister never to marry, she was committed to the group and the music. Often a faint guitar can be heard throughout the apartment, as Trini practices her guitar and nurtures her passion. </p>
